# Anomaly Detection — README

## Project overview

This repository/notebook (`/mnt/data/anomly.ipynb`) implements an anomaly-detection workflow. The goal is to detect rare or unexpected events/records (anomalies) in a dataset using one or more algorithms, evaluate their performance, and provide visual and numerical explanations of the detection behaviour.

---

## Files & where to look

* `anomly.ipynb` — primary analysis notebook (data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, plots).
* `README` (this file) — explanation of the results, interpretation guidance, and next steps.

Open the notebook and search for sections named **Data**, **Preprocessing**, **Modeling**, **Evaluation**, and **Results** — the summary of key numbers and plots is usually in the Evaluation / Results section near the end of the notebook.

## Requirements

Typical environment used to run the notebook:

* Python 3.8+ (3.9 / 3.10 recommended)
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* jupyter
* (optional) tensorflow or pytorch — if deep learning autoencoders are used
* (optional) umap-learn or openTSNE — for 2D embeddings

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Quick instructions to reproduce

1. Open `anomly.ipynb` in JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run cells in order (or run the kernel restart & run all cells).
3. If the notebook reads local files, make sure the dataset files are present in the paths shown in the Data section.
4. If a random seed is set, rerunning should give deterministic results (see Reproducibility below).

---

## Data preprocessing (what the notebook typically does)

* Missing-value handling: removal or imputation.
* Scaling / normalization (e.g., StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler) for distance-based models.
* Feature engineering (time-based features, categorical encoding, aggregation) if present.
* Train/validation/test split: depending on whether supervised labels exist, the evaluation split will be described in the notebook.

Make sure to confirm which features were used for modeling (look for a variable named `X`, `X_train`, or `features`).

---

## Methods implemented (common choices — check the notebook for exact list)

* **Statistical thresholding** (z-score, IQR): simple baseline using univariate thresholds.
* **Isolation Forest**: tree-based unsupervised detector that isolates anomalies.
* **One-Class SVM**: boundary-based method for novelty detection.
* **Autoencoder (neural)**: reconstruction-based method — anomalies have higher reconstruction error.
* **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: density-based local anomaly detector.

Each method will typically have hyperparameters tuned in the notebook (e.g., contamination in IsolationForest, hidden layer sizes in Autoencoder).

## Evaluation metrics — what they mean

Because anomaly detection can be unsupervised, evaluation depends on whether you have labeled anomalies. If you do, the notebook will usually report some or all of the following metrics:

* **Precision**: Of all points flagged as anomalies, how many are true anomalies? (High precision → few false positives.)
* **Recall (Detection Rate / True Positive Rate)**: Of all true anomalies, how many did the model find? (High recall → few false negatives.)
* **F1 score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall — useful when you need a balance.
* **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve — probability that a random anomaly is scored higher than a random normal point. For severely imbalanced datasets, PR-AUC is often more informative.
* **PR-AUC (Average Precision)**: Area under the Precision–Recall curve — emphasises performance on the positive (rare) class.
* **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: Of normal points, proportion incorrectly labeled as anomalies.

If labels are not available, typical unsupervised checks included in the notebook are:

* **Reconstruction error histograms** (for autoencoders): show separation between normals and anomalies.
* **Score distributions** from the detector: check whether anomaly scores separate classes.

## Explanation of the results (how to read what's in the notebook)

Below are general guidelines for interpreting the outputs you will see in the notebook. Replace the placeholder values with the actual numbers from the notebook when you prepare a report.

1. **Numeric summary table**: the notebook often prints a table with rows = methods and columns = metrics (Precision / Recall / F1 / AUC). Example:

   | Method          | Precision | Recall |     F1 | ROC-AUC |
   | --------------- | --------: | -----: | -----: | ------: |
   | IsolationForest |    `0.XX` | `0.XX` | `0.XX` |  `0.XX` |
   | Autoencoder     |    `0.XX` | `0.XX` | `0.XX` |  `0.XX` |

   Interpretation: a higher F1 or PR-AUC indicates better balanced performance on the rare class. If one method has much higher recall but much lower precision, it finds more anomalies but also more false alarms.

2. **ROC / PR curves**: these visualize trade-offs as you vary score threshold. If curves of different methods cross, choose the method based on the operating point (high precision vs high recall).

3. **Confusion matrix** (if thresholded): shows counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Use this to compute the cost of false positives vs false negatives in your application.

4. **Score / reconstruction error histograms**: check for separation. A clear bimodal separation suggests an easy detection problem; heavy overlap means the detector struggles and you should consider feature engineering or different modeling.

5. **Embeddings / clustering plots (t-SNE / UMAP)**: visualize whether anomalies cluster separately from normal points in 2D. These are diagnostic — good separation supports that models can learn to separate anomalies.

## Example interpretation notes (fill with your actual numbers)

* *Isolation Forest*: Precision = `<INSERT>`, Recall = `<INSERT>`. This indicates it found most anomalies but produced X% false positives — good if you prefer high recall.
* *Autoencoder*: Reconstruction error mean for anomalies = `<INSERT>`, for normals = `<INSERT>`. A large gap implies reliable thresholds can be chosen.
* *ROC-AUC*: `<INSERT>` — values close to 1.0 are excellent; \~0.5 is random.

---

## Reproducibility

* Check for random seeds in the notebook (look for `random.seed`, `np.random.seed`, `sklearn.utils.shuffle`, `tf.random.set_seed`).
* Document package versions (writing `pip freeze > requirements.txt` or printing `pip show <package>` helps). If you need, export a `requirements.txt` to freeze the environment.

---

## Limitations & caveats

* Anomaly detection performance depends heavily on feature quality: noisy or irrelevant features degrade performance.
* If the labels are incomplete or noisy, typical metrics (precision/recall) will be biased.
* Unsupervised detectors require careful threshold selection; using validation data or domain knowledge to set thresholds is recommended.
* Models trained on historical data may drift over time — monitor model performance in production.

---

## Next steps & improvements

* Try ensemble approaches (combine scores from several detectors) and calibrate thresholds using a validation set.
* Apply feature selection / dimensionality reduction to remove noisy features.
* If using autoencoders, experiment with different architectures and regularization techniques.
* Implement online monitoring & automatic threshold updating using recent labelled examples.
